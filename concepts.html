<h2>Existence Precedes Essence</h2>
<p>
The central thesis of Sartrean existentialism is encapsulated in the phrase "existence precedes essence." This principle represents a radical departure from traditional Western metaphysics, which typically held that beings possess an inherent essence that defines their nature and purpose prior to their existence. For Sartre, human beings are unique in that they are not born with a predetermined nature or essence.
</p>
<p>
This idea fundamentally challenges classical philosophical doctrines, religious teachings, and deterministic psychological theories that posit a fixed human nature. In the absence of a divine creator or inherent blueprint, humans are thrown into existence first, and only subsequently, through their free choices and actions, do they define their essence. This makes human life fundamentally a project of self-creation, where individuals are the authors of their own values, identities, and meanings.
</p>
</section>

<section id="freedom">
<h2>Radical Freedom</h2>
<p>
Sartre posits that human beings are "condemned to be free." This freedom is not merely the ability to choose between pre-existing options but is the very structure of human consciousness. It is radical because it is inescapable and precedes all other conditions. Even in situations of extreme constraint—such as imprisonment or oppression—one retains the freedom to choose one's attitude, to assign meaning to the situation, and to project oneself toward future possibilities.
</p>
<p>
This freedom is not a comfortable privilege but a fundamental burden. It means that we are continuously forced to choose and that we cannot escape making choices. Inaction itself constitutes a choice. Because there is no predetermined human nature or external authority to dictate our actions, we are left with the terrifying yet exhilarating responsibility of determining our own path.
</p>
</section>

<section id="responsibility">
<h2>Responsibility</h2>
<p>
With radical freedom comes absolute responsibility. Since we are the sole authors of our choices and actions, we cannot attribute blame to external factors such as genetics, environment, or divine will. Sartre emphasizes that when we choose a course of action, we are not only shaping our own existence but are also implicitly endorsing that action as a model for all humanity. In this sense, our individual choices have a universal dimension.
</p>
<p>
This responsibility extends beyond personal consequences to encompass the entire human condition. By choosing a particular way of life, we affirm that this way is valuable and desirable, thereby recommending it, in principle, for all. This immense responsibility can be overwhelming, but it also elevates human action to the highest ethical plane, where every decision carries the weight of a universal imperative.
</p>
</section>

<section id="anguish">
<h2>Anguish</h2>
<p>
Anguish (<em>angoisse</em>) is the emotional and psychological state that arises from the direct awareness of one's absolute freedom and the accompanying responsibility. It is not a pathological condition but a fundamental mode of human existence. Sartre distinguishes anguish from fear: fear is directed at a specific external object, whereas anguish is directed at oneself—at the recognition that one's future is undetermined and must be chosen without any guarantee or pre-established justification.
</p>
<p>
For Sartre, experiencing anguish is a sign of authenticity. It is the clear-sighted acknowledgment that we are the ultimate source of our values and actions. Leaders who must make decisions affecting thousands, artists who create without established rules, and individuals facing profound moral dilemmas all experience this existential anguish. Rather than seeking to eliminate it, existentialism encourages us to accept anguish as the necessary condition for living authentically and ethically.
</p>
</section>

<section id="badfaith">
<h2>Bad Faith</h2>
<p>
Bad faith (<em>mauvaise foi</em>) is Sartre's term for the pervasive human tendency to deny one's own freedom and responsibility. It is a form of self-deception in which individuals attempt to escape the burden of freedom by pretending to be determined by external forces. People in bad faith adopt fixed identities (e.g., "I am just a waiter," "I am a victim of my circumstances") as if these roles fully determine their actions and absolve them of choice.
</p>
<p>
Bad faith is an inauthentic mode of existence because it involves lying to oneself about the fundamental nature of human reality. It allows individuals to avoid the anxiety of freedom by hiding behind social conventions, psychological determinism, or biological essentialism. Sartre's critique of bad faith is a call to recognize and embrace our freedom, to acknowledge that we are always more than the sum of our past actions or social labels, and to take up the continuous task of self-creation with honesty and courage.
