  <h2>Existence Precedes Essence</h2>

  <p>
    Sartre’s most famous concept asserts that human beings exist before they acquire
    any defined essence or nature. Individuals are not born with predetermined purposes
    but must create meaning through action.
  </p>

  <h2>Freedom</h2>

  <p>
    Human freedom is central to Sartre’s philosophy. Even in situations of extreme
    constraint, individuals remain free in their capacity to choose how they respond.
  </p>

  <h2>Responsibility</h2>

  <p>
    With freedom comes responsibility. Sartre argues that individuals are responsible
    not only for themselves but also for humanity as a whole, since each action affirms
    a vision of what human beings ought to be.
  </p>

  <h2>Anguish</h2>

  <p>
    Anguish arises from the recognition of one’s absolute responsibility. It is not a
    psychological weakness but a rational response to freedom.
  </p>

  <h2>Bad Faith</h2>

  <p>
    Bad faith refers to the denial of one’s own freedom, often through self-deception.
    Individuals may hide behind social roles or external authorities to avoid moral
    responsibility.
