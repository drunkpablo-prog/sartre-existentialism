<h1>Key Concepts in Sartrean Existentialism</h1>

<section>
  <h2>Existence Precedes Essence</h2>
  <p>
    This foundational principle asserts that human beings are not born with a predetermined essence or nature. Unlike objects
    designed for a specific purpose, humans must create their own identity through conscious action.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Freedom</h2>
  <p>
    Sartre emphasizes radical human freedom. Individuals are always free to choose, even under conditions of extreme constraint.
    This freedom is inseparable from responsibility, as every choice reflects a personal commitment to a particular vision of
    humanity.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Responsibility</h2>
  <p>
    For Sartre, responsibility extends beyond the individual. By choosing oneself, one simultaneously chooses for all humanity.
    This universalizing dimension gives existentialist ethics its seriousness and weight.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Anguish</h2>
  <p>
    Anguish arises from the awareness of one’s radical freedom and responsibility. It is not a pathological state but a
    philosophical recognition of the burden of choice.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Bad Faith</h2>
  <p>
    Bad faith refers to the denial of one’s own freedom, often by adopting fixed social roles or external authorities as excuses.
    Sartre critiques bad faith as a form of self-deception that undermines authentic existence.
