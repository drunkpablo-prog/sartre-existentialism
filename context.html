  <h2>Europe After World War II</h2>

  <p>
    <em>Existentialism Is a Humanism</em> was delivered in 1945, immediately after the
    end of World War II. Europe was emerging from a period of unprecedented destruction,
    moral collapse, and political uncertainty. Traditional sources of meaning—religion,
    nationalism, and Enlightenment rationalism—had been deeply shaken.
  </p>

  <p>
    In this historical moment, many intellectuals questioned whether universal moral
    systems or metaphysical foundations could still be sustained. The experience of war,
    occupation, and collaboration forced individuals to confront questions of guilt,
    responsibility, and choice in concrete, often tragic circumstances.
  </p>

  <h2>The Intellectual Climate of Postwar France</h2>

  <p>
    In France, existentialism emerged as both a philosophical movement and a cultural
    phenomenon. Writers and philosophers such as Jean-Paul Sartre, Simone de Beauvoir,
    and Albert Camus addressed a broad public audience rather than an exclusively academic one.
  </p>

  <p>
    Existentialism emphasized lived experience, individual freedom, and moral
    responsibility. It rejected abstract systems detached from human life and instead
    focused on concrete human situations.
  </p>

  <h2>Existentialism as a Public Philosophy</h2>

  <p>
    Sartre’s lecture was explicitly addressed to critics who accused existentialism of
    promoting despair or moral relativism. By presenting existentialism as a form of
    humanism, Sartre sought to defend the ethical seriousness of his philosophy.
  </p>

  <p>
    The lecture thus reflects a broader postwar effort to reconstruct ethical meaning
    without reliance on transcendental guarantees. Human beings, according to Sartre,
    must assume full responsibility for the values they create.
