<h2>Europe after World War II</h2>
<p>
<em>Existentialism Is a Humanism</em> was delivered in October 1945, just months after the end of World War II. Europe stood amidst unprecedented physical destruction and profound moral disorientation. Cities lay in ruins, millions had perished, and the horrors of the Holocaust had shattered long-held beliefs in human progress and rationality. This was a continent grappling with the collapse of traditional sources of meaning—religious faith, Enlightenment optimism, and confidence in political ideologies.

</p>

<p>
In this void of certainty, individuals confronted fundamental questions about responsibility, choice, and the possibility of meaning in an apparently absurd world. The experience of total war, collaboration, and resistance forced people to reconsider the nature of human freedom and ethics. It was within this climate of crisis and questioning that existentialism emerged as a compelling philosophical response, offering a framework for understanding human existence without recourse to comforting illusions.

<h2>France after Occupation</h2>
<p>
France's particular experience during the war created a uniquely charged atmosphere for Sartre's lecture. The nation had endured four years of German occupation, followed by a painful and divisive period of liberation and purges (the <em>épuration</em>). The Vichy regime's collaboration and the complex realities of daily life under occupation—where choices between resistance, accommodation, and active collaboration were often morally ambiguous—left deep psychological and social scars.
</p>
<p>
The postwar period was marked by intense debates about collective guilt, individual responsibility, and the meaning of French identity. Sartre's existentialism, with its emphasis on absolute individual freedom and responsibility, spoke directly to this moral reckoning. It provided a language to analyze the choices made during the occupation, rejecting deterministic excuses and insisting that even in the most constrained circumstances, individuals remain responsible for their actions. The philosophy thus resonated with a nation engaged in the difficult task of reconstructing not just its infrastructure, but its moral and philosophical foundations.

<h2>The Intellectual Climate</h2>
<p>
The immediate postwar years witnessed the dramatic rise of existentialism as both a rigorous philosophical school and a broad cultural phenomenon. Centered in the cafés of Saint-Germain-des-Prés in Paris, it was championed by Jean-Paul Sartre, Simone de Beauvoir, and Albert Camus (though Camus later distanced himself from the existentialist label). This movement uniquely bridged the gap between academic philosophy and popular culture, addressing themes of freedom, anxiety, and authenticity that resonated with a generation disillusioned by the failure of traditional ideologies.
</p>
<p>
Existentialist ideas permeated literature, theater, cinema, and even fashion, creating what commentators called the "existentialist moment." However, this popularity also led to misunderstandings and criticisms from both the political left and right, as well as from religious thinkers. Some accused it of nihilism and moral relativism; others saw it as a bleak philosophy of despair. It was in part to address these widespread critiques and clarify the true ethical core of his thought that Sartre delivered his 1945 lecture.

<h2>The 1945 Public Lecture</h2>
<p>
Sartre's lecture, delivered at the Club Maintenant to a large and eager audience, was a direct intervention in the public debate surrounding existentialism. His primary aim was defensive and explanatory: to respond to critics who accused existentialism of promoting quietism, despair, and subjectivism. Sartre sought to reframe the discussion by arguing that existentialism was, in fact, the most coherent form of humanism available in the postwar world.
</p>
<p>
By asserting that "existence precedes essence," Sartre placed human freedom and self-creation at the center of his philosophy. He argued that this perspective did not lead to nihilism but to an immense ethical responsibility. In a world without God or predetermined values, humans are charged with creating value through their actions. This message of active engagement and responsibility, delivered in the aftermath of a catastrophic war, offered a path forward that was both honest about the human condition and committed to the possibility of meaning through choice and commitment. The lecture successfully repositioned existentialism as an optimistic, activist philosophy suited to the tasks of reconstruction and renewal facing Europe.
