<section id="early">
<h2>Early Life and Education (1905–1939)</h2>
<p>
Jean-Paul Charles Aymard Sartre was born on June 21, 1905, in Paris. His father, a naval officer, died when Sartre was only fifteen months old, leaving him to be raised by his mother, Anne-Marie Schweitzer, and his maternal grandfather, Karl Schweitzer, a professor of German. This intellectually stimulating environment exposed Sartre to classical literature and philosophy from an early age, profoundly shaping his intellectual development.
</p>
<p>
Sartre attended the prestigious Lycée Henri-IV in Paris before entering the École Normale Supérieure, where he studied philosophy from 1924 to 1929. It was here that he formed his lifelong intellectual and personal partnership with Simone de Beauvoir, a relationship that would become central to both their lives and work. During this formative period, Sartre was deeply influenced by German phenomenology, particularly the works of Edmund Husserl and Martin Heidegger, whose focus on consciousness and being would become foundational to his own philosophical system.

<section id="war">
<h2>War and Occupation (1939–1945)</h2>
<p>
The outbreak of World War II marked a decisive turning point in Sartre's life and thought. Drafted into the French army in 1939, he served as a meteorologist before being captured by German forces in 1940. His nine months as a prisoner of war were a period of intense reflection, solidifying his ideas about individual freedom and responsibility within constrained circumstances.
</p>
<p>
After his release in 1941, Sartre returned to occupied Paris, where he became involved in the intellectual resistance. He continued to write prolifically, publishing his magnum opus, <em>Being and Nothingness</em>, in 1943. This dense philosophical work systematically articulated the principles of his existentialist philosophy. Simultaneously, his plays, most notably <em>The Flies</em> (1943) and <em>No Exit</em> (1944), served as powerful, accessible vehicles for existentialist themes, exploring responsibility, choice, and human relationships under extreme conditions.

<section id="postwar">
<h2>Postwar Fame (1945–1960)</h2>
<p>
In the immediate aftermath of World War II, Sartre emerged as France's preeminent public intellectual and the leading voice of existentialism. His October 1945 lecture, "Existentialism Is a Humanism," was a cultural event that passionately defended his philosophy against charges of pessimism and defined it as a doctrine of action, responsibility, and human dignity.
</p>
<p>
Sartre tirelessly championed the concept of the <em>engaged intellectual</em> (<em>l'intellectuel engagé</em>), arguing that writers and thinkers have a fundamental responsibility to participate in the political struggles of their time. He co-founded the influential literary and political journal <em>Les Temps Modernes</em> and produced an extraordinary body of work spanning novels, plays, philosophical treatises, and political essays, consistently seeking to bridge abstract philosophy with concrete social and political realities.
</p>

<section id="legacy">
<h2>Later Years and Legacy (1960–1980)</h2>
<p>
In his later years, Sartre became increasingly involved in political activism, supporting anti-colonial movements and participating in the protests of May 1968. In a defining act of principle, he declined the 1964 Nobel Prize in Literature, stating that a writer must not allow himself to be transformed into an institution. His later philosophical work, particularly the <em>Critique of Dialectical Reason</em> (1960), represented an ambitious attempt to reconcile existentialism with Marxism.
</p>
<p>
Jean-Paul Sartre died on April 15, 1980, in Paris. His funeral procession drew tens of thousands of mourners, a testament to his profound impact on French intellectual and cultural life. Sartre's legacy endures not only in academic philosophy but in broader cultural understandings of freedom, authenticity, and responsibility. His insistence that "man is condemned to be free" and that we create ourselves through our choices continues to challenge and inspire readers worldwide, securing his place as one of the most significant thinkers of the twentieth century.
