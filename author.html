  <p>
    Jean-Paul Sartre (1905–1980) was a French philosopher, novelist, playwright, and
    public intellectual. He is widely regarded as one of the central figures of
    twentieth-century existentialism.
  </p>

  <p>
    Sartre’s philosophy is deeply shaped by phenomenology, particularly the work of
    Edmund Husserl and Martin Heidegger. His major philosophical works include
    <em>Being and Nothingness</em> (1943) and <em>Existentialism Is a Humanism</em> (1945).
  </p>

  <p>
    Beyond philosophy, Sartre was actively engaged in political and social debates.
    He famously refused the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1964, arguing that a writer
    should not become an institution.
