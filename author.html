    <h2>Early Life and Education (1905–1939)</h2>
    <p>
      Jean-Paul Sartre was born in Paris in 1905. After the early death of his father,
      he was raised primarily by his mother and grandfather, who introduced him to
      classical literature and philosophy at an early age.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sartre studied philosophy at the École Normale Supérieure, where he met Simone de
      Beauvoir, who would become both his lifelong intellectual partner and a major
      philosophical figure in her own right. During this period, Sartre was deeply
      influenced by German philosophy, particularly the works of Husserl and Heidegger.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>War, Occupation, and Existential Thought (1939–1945)</h2>
    <p>
      The outbreak of World War II marked a turning point in Sartre’s intellectual
      development. He was drafted into the French army and later became a prisoner of
      war. These experiences intensified his reflection on freedom, responsibility,
      and human choice under extreme conditions.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the German occupation of France, Sartre continued writing and began to
      articulate the philosophical ideas that would later be associated with
      existentialism. His focus shifted from abstract philosophy toward concrete human
      situations.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Postwar Fame and Public Engagement (1945–1960)</h2>
    <p>
      After the war, Sartre emerged as one of the most influential public intellectuals
      in France. His lecture <em>Existentialism Is a Humanism</em> (1945) introduced
      existentialist ideas to a broad audience and sparked intense public debate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sartre believed that philosophers should engage directly with social and political
      issues. He wrote novels, plays, essays, and political commentary, seeking to bridge
      philosophy and everyday life.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Later Years and Legacy (1960–1980)</h2>
    <p>
      In his later years, Sartre became increasingly involved in political activism,
      supporting anti-colonial movements and criticizing institutional power. In 1964,
      he famously refused the Nobel Prize in Literature, arguing that writers should
      remain independent from official recognition.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sartre died in 1980, leaving behind a body of work that continues to shape modern
      philosophy, literature, and cultural theory. His insistence on human freedom and
      responsibility remains central to existentialist thought.
