  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    This website is an exhibition-style academic project introducing Jean-Paul Sartre
    and his lecture <em>Existentialism Is a Humanism</em>. The purpose of the site is not
    technical sophistication, but the combination of Western philosophical thought
    with a basic web-based form of presentation.
  </p>

  <p>
    Sartre delivered the lecture in 1945, in the aftermath of World War II, at a moment
    when European intellectuals were rethinking freedom, responsibility, and human
    meaning. Existentialism was widely criticized at the time as pessimistic or immoral.
    Sartre’s lecture is a direct response to these accusations.
  </p>

  <h2>Existence Precedes Essence</h2>
  <p>
    Sartre’s most famous claim is that existence precedes essence. Human beings are not
    born with a predefined nature or purpose. Instead, they exist first and define
    themselves through action. This idea challenges traditional religious and
    metaphysical conceptions of human nature.
  </p>

  <h2>Freedom and Responsibility</h2>
  <p>
    According to Sartre, human freedom is unavoidable. Every action, including inaction,
    constitutes a choice. With freedom comes absolute responsibility—not only for
    oneself, but for humanity as a whole.
  </p>

  <h2>Why Existentialism Is a Humanism</h2>
  <p>
    Sartre argues that existentialism is a form of humanism because it places human
    beings at the center of meaning-making. There is no authority higher than human
    action and commitment. Human dignity arises from the capacity to choose and to act
    responsibly.
