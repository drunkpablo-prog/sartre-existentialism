    <h2>Background of the Lecture</h2>

    <p>
      <em>Existentialism Is a Humanism</em> originated not as an academic treatise, but as a public lecture delivered by Jean-Paul Sartre in Paris in October 1945. This timing is profoundly significant, coinciding with a Europe emerging from the physical and moral ruins of the Second World War. A searching public was grappling with profound questions of meaning, responsibility, and the future of humanity. Sartre, already a prominent intellectual figure, sought to clarify a philosophical movement that had been subject to widespread simplification and critique, often mischaracterized as pessimistic or nihilistic.
    </p>

    <p>
      Unlike his monumental work <em>Being and Nothingness</em> (1943), this lecture was intentionally accessible, crafted for a broad, educated audience. Its subsequent publication solidified its status as one of the most lucid and influential introductions to existentialist thought, serving as the definitive gateway to Sartre’s more complex philosophy for generations of readers.

  <section id="thesis">
    <h2>The Central Thesis: Existence Precedes Essence</h2>

    <p>
      At the heart of Sartre’s argument is the revolutionary proposition that for human beings, <strong>“existence precedes essence.”</strong> This concise phrase dismantles centuries of philosophical and theological tradition which held that humans possess a pre-defined essence—a fundamental nature or purpose determined by a divine creator or a cosmic order.
    </p>

    <p>
      Sartre offers a compelling analogy: an artisan crafting a paperknife first conceives its essence (its purpose, form, and method of production) before bringing it into existence. In stark contrast, a human being is not born with a designed purpose. We first simply <em>exist</em>, find ourselves in the world, and only subsequently, through a lifetime of actions, choices, and commitments, do we define our own essence. There is no pre-existing blueprint for what a human being ought to be; we are the authors of our own nature.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- Section 3 -->
  <section id="arguments">
    <h2>Key Philosophical Arguments</h2>

    <p>
      Sartre constructs his case by systematically rejecting alternate accounts of human nature. He confronts the theological perspective directly: if God does not exist, there is no divine plane of values, no commandments written into the fabric of being to guide us. We are alone, without excuse, in a universe devoid of inherent meaning.
    </p>

    <p>
      This radical abandonment leads to the core of existentialist responsibility. Since there is no predetermined essence, <strong>we are condemned to be free.</strong> Every individual is wholly responsible for their own being. To act is to affirm a value, to choose an image of what humanity should be. Furthermore, Sartre contends that in choosing for oneself, one is simultaneously <strong>choosing for all of humanity.</strong> My action commits me to the view that this is how a human being <em>ought</em> to act, thus magnifying individual responsibility to a universal scale.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- Section 4 -->
  <section id="ethics">
    <h2>Ethical and Moral Implications</h2>

    <p>
      Far from promoting moral relativism or license, Sartrean existentialism imposes a severe and demanding ethical framework. The recognition of total freedom and responsibility gives rise to a profound sense of <strong>anguish (</strong><em>angoisse</em><strong>)</strong>. This is not a psychological weakness but the sober, inescapable awareness of being the author of one's world and, by extension, an architect of the human condition.
    </p>

    <p>
      This responsibility demands <strong>authenticity</strong>—living in "good faith" by fully acknowledging one's freedom. Its opposite, "bad faith," is the self-deception by which we flee from this freedom, pretending we are determined by circumstance, genetics, or social conditioning. Authentic existence requires engagement and commitment, as we create values through our projects in the world.
    </p>

  <!-- Section 5 -->
  <section id="misunderstandings">
    <h2>Common Misunderstandings</h2>

    <p>
      A central aim of the lecture was to correct prevalent criticisms. Sartre directly rebuts those who labeled existentialism as a philosophy of despair, quietism, or nihilism. He argues it is, in fact, a philosophy of action and optimism. Its harshness lies not in the human condition, but in the sternness of its doctrine, which places the entire burden—and glory—of creating value upon humanity itself.
    </p>

    <p>
      The lecture concludes by reclaiming and redefining <strong>humanism.</strong> Sartre rejects classical humanisms based on a fixed, admirable human essence. Instead, he proposes an existentialist humanism: "Man is nothing else but what he makes of himself." True humanism, for Sartre, is grounded not in abstract ideals but in the concrete reality of human action, freedom, and the perpetual project of self-creation and engagement with others.
