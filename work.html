<section id="origin">
<h2>Origin of the Text</h2>
<p>
<em>Existentialism Is a Humanism</em> originated not as a formal academic treatise, but as a public lecture delivered by Jean-Paul Sartre in Paris in October 1945. This timing is historically significant, occurring as Europe was emerging from the devastation of World War II, a period when fundamental questions about human nature, morality, and meaning were being urgently reconsidered.
</p>
<p>
The lecture was delivered at the Club Maintenant, an intellectual forum in post-war Paris, to a packed audience. Sartre's aim was to address the widespread public interest in existentialism while countering common misinterpretations and criticisms that had emerged in the popular press. The text was subsequently published in written form in 1946, quickly becoming one of Sartre's most accessible and widely read works, serving as the primary introduction to existentialist thought for countless readers worldwide.
</p>

<section id="aim">
<h2>Purpose and Argument</h2>
<p>
The central purpose of the lecture was to articulate and defend existentialism as a coherent, optimistic, and ethical philosophy. Sartre sought to refute accusations that existentialism promoted pessimism, nihilism, or quietism. Instead, he presented it as a philosophy of action, freedom, and responsibility that affirms human dignity.
</p>
<p>
The core argument revolves around Sartre's famous dictum: <strong>"existence precedes essence."</strong> This revolutionary principle asserts that humans are not born with a predetermined nature, purpose, or set of values. Unlike a manufactured object (such as a paperknife) that is created according to a pre-existing blueprint, human beings first exist, and only subsequently define their essence through their actions, choices, and commitments. This radical freedom is both our burden and our greatness—we are "condemned to be free" and must bear the full weight of creating our own values and meanings.
</p>

<h2>Structure of the Lecture</h2>
<p>
The lecture is structured as a direct response to critics and a systematic exposition of existentialist principles. It begins by identifying and addressing four main criticisms leveled against existentialism: that it invites quietism, emphasizes human despair, isolates individuals in subjectivity, and denies the seriousness of human enterprise.
</p>
<p>
Sartre then proceeds to outline the fundamental tenets of his philosophy. He explains the concept of "abandonment" (the absence of God and predetermined values), the resulting "anguish" of absolute responsibility, and the "forlornness" of having to act without guarantee. A significant portion is dedicated to illustrating how, in choosing for oneself, one chooses for all humanity, thereby establishing an intersubjective ethics. The lecture culminates in a redefinition of humanism—not as a belief in a pre-given human essence, but as the recognition that humanity is constantly projecting itself beyond itself through action and commitment.

<section id="impact">
<h2>Philosophical Impact</h2>
<p>
<em>Existentialism Is a Humanism</em> played a pivotal role in popularizing existentialist philosophy beyond academic circles and cementing Sartre's position as its leading public exponent. It provided a clear, compelling, and relatively concise manifesto that resonated deeply in the post-war intellectual climate, offering a framework for understanding human freedom and responsibility in a world that had witnessed the collapse of traditional certainties.
</p>
<p>
The text's impact endures in contemporary philosophical and cultural discourse. Its arguments continue to inform debates in ethics, political philosophy, and the philosophy of action. By insisting that we are the authors of our own lives and values, Sartre's lecture remains a powerful call to authenticity, engagement, and the sober acceptance of our fundamental freedom. It stands as one of the defining philosophical statements of the 20th century and a cornerstone of existentialist literature.
