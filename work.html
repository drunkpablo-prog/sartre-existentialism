    <h2>Background of the Lecture</h2>

    <p>
      <em>Existentialism Is a Humanism</em> originated as a public lecture delivered by
      Jean-Paul Sartre in Paris in October 1945, shortly after the end of World War II.
      The lecture was later published in written form and quickly became one of Sartre’s
      most widely read philosophical texts.
    </p >

    <p>
      Unlike Sartre’s major philosophical works such as <em>Being and Nothingness</em>,
      this lecture was not intended for a specialized academic audience. Instead, it was
      designed to address the general public and to clarify widespread misunderstandings
      about existentialism.
    </p >

  <!-- Section 2 -->
  <section id="thesis">
    <h2>The Central Thesis: Existence Precedes Essence</h2>

    <p>
      The central claim of the lecture is Sartre’s famous assertion that “existence precedes
      essence.” By this, Sartre means that human beings are not born with a predefined nature,
      purpose, or moral essence.
    </p >

    <p>
      In contrast to objects such as tools, which are designed according to a specific
      function, human beings first exist and only later define themselves through their
      actions and choices. There is no fixed blueprint for what a human being ought to be.
    </p >
  </section>

  <!-- Section 3 -->
  <section id="arguments">
    <h2>Key Philosophical Arguments</h2>

    <p>
      Sartre develops his argument by rejecting both theological and deterministic accounts
      of human nature. If God does not exist, there can be no divine plan that determines
      human values or purposes.
    </p >

    <p>
      As a result, individuals must take full responsibility for their choices. Every action
      becomes an expression of how one believes human beings ought to live, making each
      decision universally significant.
    </p >
  </section>

  <!-- Section 4 -->
  <section id="ethics">
    <h2>Ethical and Moral Implications</h2>

    <p>
      Far from promoting moral relativism, Sartre argues that existentialism places an
      immense ethical burden on the individual. To choose for oneself is simultaneously
      to choose for all of humanity.
    </p >

    <p>
      This responsibility often produces anguish, a recognition of the weight of one’s
      freedom. Sartre insists that such anguish is not a weakness but a necessary condition
      of ethical seriousness.
    </p >
  </section>

  <!-- Section 5 -->
  <section id="misunderstandings">
    <h2>Common Misunderstandings</h2>

    <p>
      Sartre responds to critics who accuse existentialism of encouraging despair,
      passivity, or nihilism. On the contrary, he argues that existentialism affirms
      human dignity by emphasizing freedom, responsibility, and commitment.
    </p >

    <p>
      The lecture concludes by redefining humanism: not as a doctrine based on abstract
      ideals, but as one grounded in concrete human action and responsibility.
