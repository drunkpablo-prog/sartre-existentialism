<h1>Existentialism Is a Humanism</h1>

<section>
  <h2>Origin of the Text</h2>
  <p>
    <em>Existentialism Is a Humanism</em> originated as a public lecture delivered by Jean-Paul Sartre in Paris in 1945.
    The lecture was intended as a response to widespread misunderstandings and criticisms of existentialist philosophy,
    particularly accusations that existentialism promotes despair, moral nihilism, or political irresponsibility.

  <h2>Purpose and Audience</h2>
  <p>
    Sartre’s primary aim was to clarify existentialism for a general audience. Rather than presenting a technical philosophical
    treatise, the lecture adopts a polemical and accessible tone. Sartre defends existentialism as a philosophy that emphasizes
    human freedom, responsibility, and ethical seriousness.

  <h2>Main Argument</h2>
  <p>
    The central thesis of the work is that “existence precedes essence.” Sartre argues that human beings are not born with a fixed
    nature or predetermined purpose. Instead, individuals first exist and subsequently define themselves through their actions.
  </p>
  <p>
    From this premise, Sartre derives a moral framework in which individuals are fully responsible not only for themselves but also
    for humanity as a whole. Every choice, he argues, implicitly affirms a vision of what human beings ought to be.

  <h2>Reception and Influence</h2>
  <p>
    Upon publication, <em>Existentialism Is a Humanism</em> became one of Sartre’s most widely read works. While some philosophers
    criticized its simplifications, the text played a crucial role in popularizing existentialist thought and shaping post-war
    intellectual culture in Europe and beyond.
