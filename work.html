  <h2>Origin of the Lecture</h2>

  <p>
    <em>Existentialism Is a Humanism</em> originated as a public lecture delivered by
    Jean-Paul Sartre in Paris in October 1945. The lecture was later published in written
    form and became one of Sartre’s most widely read philosophical texts.
  </p>

  <p>
    Unlike Sartre’s more technical philosophical works, this lecture was intended for
    a general audience. Its aim was to clarify existentialism and to respond to public
    misunderstandings surrounding the movement.
  </p>

  <h2>Central Philosophical Claim</h2>

  <p>
    The central thesis of the work is the claim that “existence precedes essence.”
    Sartre argues that human beings are not born with a predefined nature or purpose.
    Instead, individuals must define themselves through their actions and choices.
  </p>

  <p>
    This claim directly challenges philosophical and theological traditions that assume
    a fixed human essence determined by God, nature, or reason.
  </p>

  <h2>Ethical Implications</h2>

  <p>
    Sartre emphasizes that radical human freedom entails radical responsibility.
    By choosing oneself, one also chooses an image of humanity as a whole. Moral
    responsibility is therefore inescapable.
  </p>

  <p>
    In this sense, the work presents existentialism not as a philosophy of despair,
    but as a serious ethical position grounded in human freedom.
